  <summary><h2>P4 - Web scraping</h2></summary>

This is one of the pre-defined project ideas you can choose for your project.

### Web scraping

In this project, you shall use a web scraping library to download articles that can be used in your search engine from Assignment 3.

If you use Python, the [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) library is very powerful and easy to use. A quick start guide can be found [here](https://realpython.com/python-web-scraping-practical-introduction/). For Java can check out [HtmlUnit](http://htmlunit.sourceforge.net/). A quick start guide can be found [here](https://ksah.in/introduction-to-web-scraping-with-java/).

When scraping a site such as Wikipedia, you usually start on one page and follow all outgoing links.

You can download pages from Wikipedia or any other site.
